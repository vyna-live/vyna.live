Understanding the problem
The error message AgoraRTCException: AgoraRTCError CAN_NOT_GET_GATEWAY_SERVER: flag: 4096, message: AgoraRTCError CAN_NOT_GET_GATEWAY_SERVER: invalid token, authorized failed indicates that the Agora Web SDK is unable to connect to the gateway server because the token provided for authentication is invalid. The specific message invalid token, authorized failed pinpoints the issue to token authorization failure. This typically occurs when the token used to join the Agora channel is incorrect, expired, or has been revoked. The error occurs during the process of initializing the Agora service, specifically when joining a channel.

Based on the search results, this error aligns with the scenario where:

A token is required for authentication (Primary/Secondary certificate is enabled).
The token provided is either not valid or has expired.
The web console message is equivalent to ERR_NO_AUTHORIZED(110).
The code snippet provided console.error("Error initializing Agora:", ES), _E(ES instanceof Error ? ES.message : "Failed to join stream"), _p(!1) shows how the error is handled in your application, where:

console.error logs the error to the console.
_E seems to be a custom error handling function that is called when an error is caught.
_p(!1) seems to be a function that will be called to set the connection state to disconnected.
How to verify
Check Token Validity: Ensure the token you are using is generated correctly and is not expired. Compare the token against the criteria outlined in the documentation to make sure it complies with what is needed to connect.
App ID: The App ID must be correct and active in your Agora project. An inactive or incorrect ID can also cause issues.
Network: Verify that you have a stable network connection. Network issues can sometime affect the connectivity to the Agora gateway server.
Error Codes: The error code 4096 (flag) is also a sign that the issue is with the token authorization. Cross-reference this with Agora's error code documentation if you need further insights.
DNS server settings. According to search result \[2], make sure your DNS server is set to 114.114.114.114 if the user is in mainland china or 8.8.8.8 if the user is outside of mainland China.
Suggested fix
The primary solution is to ensure a valid token is used. Follow these steps:

Token Generation:
Tokens should be generated on your server, not on the client-side (for security).
Make sure the token generation process on your server is correct.
Tokens expire. You need a mechanism to generate and provide fresh tokens to the client.
Token Renewal:
Implement a mechanism to detect when a token is about to expire or has expired.
When the token is invalid or has expired, get a new token from your server.
Use the renewToken function to use the new token.
Error Handling:
Improve the error handling on the client-side. When this error is caught, inform the user about the issue. Give the user the option to get a new token or reconnect.
Use the onError callback to check if the token has expired.
Here's an example of how to modify your code to include token renewal:

js

async function joinChannel(token, uid, channelName) {
  try {
    const client = AgoraRTC.createClient({ mode: "rtc", codec: "vp8" });
    await client.join(YOUR_APP_ID, channelName, token, uid);
    // Join success!
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.code === "ERR_NO_AUTHORIZED") { // Handle specific token-related errors
      // Token has expired. Prompt user to get a new token or implement automatic token renewal.
      console.error("Token expired or invalid. Please renew token.");
      let newToken = await getNewTokenFromServer(); // Your function to get a new token from the server
      await client.renewToken(newToken);
      // Retry the join with the new token
      await joinChannel(newToken, uid, channelName)
    } else {
      console.error("Error initializing Agora:", error);
      _E(error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Failed to join stream");
      _p(!1);
    }
  }
}
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error CAN_NOT_GET_GATEWAY_SERVER: invalid token, authorized failed in the Agora Web SDK means the provided token for joining a channel is invalid. The solution is to generate valid tokens on the server-side, implement token renewal, and handle token-related errors on the client-side. Always make sure to check the App ID and make sure the userâ€™s DNS is set appropriately.
