Task: Comprehensive Migration to USDC-Only Subscription System
Overview
Transform our subscription payment system from dual-currency (SOL and USDC) to USDC-only. This requires extensive modifications across the entire application architecture, including front-end components, payment processing logic, transaction verification systems, feature access control based on subscription tiers, and database schema adjustments.
Critical Technical Considerations
Currency-Specific Implementation Details
USDC Decimal Precision: USDC operates with 6 decimal places , unlike SOL which uses 9 decimal places 
Amount Conversion: Ensure all amount calculations properly handle the decimal precision difference when migrating from SOL to USDC
Display Formatting: Standardize USDC display to 2 decimal places in UI while maintaining full precision in calculations
Transaction Validation: Account for decimal precision in all transaction verification algorithms
Feature Access Control System
The application features available to users are directly tied to their current subscription plan
All feature access checks must be updated to reference the user's USDC-based subscription status
Implement graceful degradation for users with expired subscriptions
Display appropriate upgrade prompts when users attempt to access features not included in their current plan
Implementation Requirements
1. Payment Processing Architecture

Remove SOL Payment Infrastructure

oEliminate all SOL-related payment endpoints, methods, and handlers
oUpdate blockchain listeners to ignore SOL transactions
oRemove all SOL wallet connection options and related UI elements

USDC Transaction Processing

oEnhance USDC payment processor to handle all subscription types
oUpdate transaction listeners to properly validate USDC transactions with correct decimal precision
oImplement comprehensive error handling for failed USDC transactions
oCreate detailed transaction logs with standardized formats for USDC payments

Payment Verification Logic

oImplement precise amount matching that accounts for USDC's 6 decimal places
oFor exact plan amount matches: process subscription activation immediately
oFor underpayments: calculate exact balance due with precision and present clear payment options
oFor overpayments: implement configurable handling (store as credit, refund, or apply to next billing cycle)
oAdd anti-fraud checks for suspicious transaction patterns
2. UI Component System Updates

Subscription Plan Selection UI

oUpdate all plan cards to show USDC-only pricing with proper decimal formatting
oRemove currency toggle components and related state management
oAdd clear USDC icons/indicators to pricing elements
oImplement price comparison visualizations for different subscription tiers

Checkout Flow

oRedesign checkout pages to focus exclusively on USDC payment options
oUpdate all payment forms to remove SOL fields and validation
oEnhance USDC payment instructions with detailed wallet connection steps
oAdd real-time USDC balance checking when possible
oImplement clearer transaction status indicators during payment processing

User Dashboard

oUpdate subscription management views to show USDC payment history
oRevise upcoming payment notifications to reference USDC amounts
oImplement clear visual indicators of current plan features and limitations
oAdd upgrade paths with USDC price differentials clearly displayed

Admin Interfaces(not yet implemented though)

oUpdate subscription management tools to handle USDC-only transactions
oRevise reporting interfaces to properly display USDC amounts
oAdd migration tools for manually converting legacy SOL subscriptions
3. Database and Data Model Updates
Update subscribtions to:
Add feature access control mapping for each plan tier

o
5. Blockchain Transaction Verification

USDC-Specific Transaction Validation
Implement precise validation logic for USDC transactions: 
Transaction Receipt Generation

oCreate detailed receipts for all USDC transactions
oInclude blockchain confirmation details with transaction signatures
oStandardize receipt format across all subscription plans
Documentation Updates

oRevise all payment-related documentation to reflect USDC-only process
oCreate FAQ section specifically addressing the currency transition
oUpdate API documentation for developers integrating with the payment system
Implementation Phases and Testing Strategy
Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure
1.Update database schema for USDC-only transactions
2.Implement precise USDC transaction verification with decimal handling
3.Migrate existing subscription data with proper currency conversion
4.Update feature access control system to work with new subscription model
Phase 2: UI Component Updates
1.Redesign subscription selection and checkout flows for USDC-only
2.Implement clear payment status indicators and error messages
3.Add plan-specific feature gates to all restricted components
