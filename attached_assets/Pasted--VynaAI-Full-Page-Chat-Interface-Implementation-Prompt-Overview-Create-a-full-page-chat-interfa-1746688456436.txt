# VynaAI Full Page Chat Interface Implementation Prompt

## Overview
Create a full-page chat interface for VynaAI that exactly matches the provided reference image. This is the expanded view that appears after a user sends a question, showing both the conversation history and allowing continued interaction.

## Core Layout Requirements

### Navigation and Header
- Implement a dark header bar with the Vyna logo on the left (semi-circle with text "Vyna") and a "Login" button on the right
- Below the main header, create a secondary navigation bar with:
  - A document/page icon on the far left
  - Two tab buttons: "VynaAI" (active, with star icon) and "Notepad" (with document icon)
  - A back arrow and conversation title "About solana" in the center
  - A dropdown/expand button on the far right

### Sidebar
- Create a left sidebar with:
  - A "New chat" button at the top with a plus (+) icon (beige/tan colored)
  - "RECENTS" section header in gray uppercase text
  - A scrollable list of recent conversation items (all showing "Who is the best CODM gamer in Nigeria as of..." in the example)
  - Each conversation item should have an options menu (three dots) on the right
  - Active/selected conversation should be subtly highlighted

### Main Chat Area
- The main content area should display:
  - User messages right-aligned in dark gray rounded boxes
  - AI responses left-aligned in lighter gray rounded boxes with a small avatar circle
  - Each AI message should include reaction buttons below (regenerate, thumbs up, thumbs down, info, options)
  - A clear visual distinction between user and AI messages

### Input Area
- At the bottom of the screen, implement an input box with:
  - Placeholder text "Ask a question"
  - Utility buttons on the left (paperclip, microphone, camera)
  - "Send" button on the right with upward arrow icon and tan/beige background
  - The input area should be slightly separated from the chat content above

## Visual Design Specifications
- Use a pure black (#000000) background for the entire page
- Dark gray (#1A1A1A) for the sidebar
- Slightly lighter gray (#232323) for input boxes and AI message backgrounds
- Dark gray (#2A2A2A) for user message backgrounds
- Light gray text for messages and white for important text
- Maintain the exact styling of all buttons and interactive elements
- Ensure all rounded corners match the reference (moderately rounded)
- Use the exact same iconography as shown in the reference image

## Content Example
- User message example: "Tell me about solana like I am a two year old"
- AI response should match the format of the example explaining Solana in simple terms
- The response style should be conversational and formatted with proper paragraph breaks

## Technical Implementation
- Ensure the interface is responsive but optimized for desktop view
- Implement proper scrolling behavior for both sidebar and main chat area
- Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate hover states
- The input field should expand appropriately based on content
- Implement the tab switching functionality between VynaAI and Notepad

## Critical Interaction Details
- When a user types a question and clicks send:
  - The question should appear in the chat history
  - The AI response should appear with a subtle animation
  - The input field should clear and remain focused for the next question
  - The conversation should be added to the recents list in the sidebar
  - The URL/page title should update to reflect the conversation topic

## Important
- Match the EXACT layout, spacing, and styling of the reference image
- Do not add features or elements not visible in the reference
- Ensure the color scheme precisely matches the dark theme shown
- Maintain the exact same look and feel of all components
